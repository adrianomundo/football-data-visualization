# DataVizDashApp

This repository contains the final project of the Data and Results Visualization's course at POLIMI, held by Professor Loiacono.
The project is based on the implementation of a machine learning algorithm that is able to forecast the best players of the future season in Serie A.
Actually, the real goal is to represent the results in an effective way in order to help players of Fantacalcio during the auctions.
